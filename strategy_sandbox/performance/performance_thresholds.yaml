# Performance regression detection thresholds configuration
# This file defines when performance changes should be considered regressions
# and trigger alerts at different severity levels.

thresholds:
  # Execution time thresholds (higher values are worse)
  execution_time:
    relative_increase: 0.10          # 10% increase triggers regression
    absolute_increase: 0.100         # 100ms absolute increase triggers regression
    statistical_significance: 0.95   # 95% confidence level for statistical tests

  # Memory usage thresholds (higher values are worse)
  memory_usage:
    relative_increase: 0.15          # 15% increase triggers regression
    absolute_increase: 50.0          # 50MB absolute increase triggers regression
    statistical_significance: 0.95   # 95% confidence level for statistical tests

  # Throughput thresholds (lower values are worse, so negative thresholds)
  throughput:
    relative_increase: -0.10         # 10% decrease triggers regression
    absolute_increase: -100.0        # 100 ops/sec decrease triggers regression
