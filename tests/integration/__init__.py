"""Integration tests for strategy sandbox components.

This module contains integration tests that verify the interaction between
multiple components of the strategy sandbox system, including:

- Environment initialization and coordination
- Strategy execution with market simulation
- Balance management integration
- Event system integration
- Data provider integration
- Error handling across component boundaries
- Async coordination between components

All tests in this module are marked with @pytest.mark.integration
to distinguish them from unit tests.
